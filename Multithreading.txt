Multithreading
===================
Every thread has the priority inherited from its parent by default. Main thread priority is by default 5.
Green thread(Deprecated) means the thread which is completely handled by JVM without the support of underlying OS support. EX: SUN solaris is the OS which supports Green thread
Every ThreadGroup by default a child group to System(Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup().getParent().getName())
system group contains several system level threads.(Finalizer, Reference Handler, Signal dispatcher, Attach Listener)
threadgroup.setMaxpriority() --> Threads in the thread group that have already higher priority wont be effected but for newly added threads max priority is applicable(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2L-vVpFP7Y --- Multithreading Enhancement Part- 1|| Introduction || Thread Group)
thread.stop() is deprecated and not recommended to use because for ex: if one thread has the logic of open db connection, fetch data and release connection. If this thread is stopped/killed in the middle who is responsible to release the connection means connection is wasted here.
suspend(), resume() are deprecated.
Daemon thread is a thread which runs in background to support non-daemon threads(EX: Signal dispatcher, Attach Listener, Garbage collector)
isDaemon(), setDaemon()

Lock: (java.util.concurrent.locks from 1.5v)
=============================================
The problems with traditional 'synchronized' keyword
1)We r not having any flexibility to try for a lock without waiting
2) There is no way to specify to wait for maximum time for a thread to get lock so that thread will wait until getting the lock which may creates performance problems
which may cause deadlock
3)If a thread releases lock then which waiting thread will get that lock, we are not having any control on this
4) There is no api to list out all waiting threads for a lock
5)Synchronized we can use either at method level or within the method and it is not possible to use across multiple methods

Volatile vs atomic variables
Volatile -Ensures visibility of changes, suited for simple flags,
Atomic variables - provides atomic operations,  better for complex operations like counters.


Runnable vs Callable
	Runnable run method does not throw checked exception(public void run(){})
	Callable call method throw Exception (public T call()throws Exception{}) 
execute vs submit
	return type is void for execute,
	return type is Future<T> if submit callable, Future<Void> for runnables


java.util.concurrent :
======================
Queue, BlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue, PriorityBlockingQueue(Comparable), (java 6 : -) DelayQueue(Delayed), Synchronous Queue, BlockingDeque, LinkedBlockingDeque


Throws Exception	Special Value	Blocks	Times Out
Insert	add(o)	offer(o)	put(o)	offer(o, timeout, timeunit)
Remove	remove(o)	poll()	take()	poll(timeout, timeunit)
Examine	element()	peek()	 	 

CountDownLatch(await(), countDown())
CyclicBarrier
Exchanger(exchange())
Semaphore(acquire(), release())
ExecutorService
ThreadPoolExecutor
ScheduledExecutorService
ForkJoinPool
Lock(lock(), unlock(), trylock(), trylock(time)) - similar to synchronized
Condition(await, signal, singnalAll) - similar to wait, notify, notifyAll
ReadWriteLock
AtomicInteger(getAndAdd(),getAndIncrement())
AtomicReferenceObject

ConcurrentHashMap(Bucket level Locking, PutIfAbsent(-,-), remove(-,-), replace(-,-,-))
CopyonArrayList(UnsupportedOperationException, addIfAbsent(), addAllAbsent())
CopyonArraySet

join() vs get()
	join() throws runtime exception (CompletionException, CancellationException)
		CancellationException - if the computation was cancelled
		CompletionException - if this future completedexceptionally or a completion computation threw an exception
	get() throws checked exceptions (InterruptedException, ExecutionException) or runtime exception (CancellationException)
		CancellationException if this future was cancelled
		ExecutionException if this future completed exceptionally
		InterruptedException if the current thread was interrupted
