Difference between interfaces and abstract classes in java 8
SerialVersion id?

for-each vs iterator
Singleton?how to write? what are the ways to break singleton and solutions?
Marker interface - Cloneable, Serializable
JVM architecture (https://dzone.com/articles/jvm-architecture-explained)
	https://dzone.com/articles/jvm-architecture-explained
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-works-jvm-architecture/
Java MemoryManagement (heap, non heap[code cache, permgen[method area, string pool]], stack area, PC registers, native stack)
jvm vs jre vs jdk

Garbage collection process and how do you identify memory leaks?(JvisualVM command and 3rd party plugins or tools)
	https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/garbage-collection-java/
Exception Handling:
===================
Exception swallowing
How will you write business exceptions?
How will you avoid NullpointerExceptions? Will you catch NullpointerExceptions in your project?
(No, we will check if null, log it and then throws business exception)
https://dzone.com/articles/9-best-practices-to-handle-exceptions-in-java
Will an Error Be Caught by Catch Block in Java - https://www.baeldung.com/java-error-catch
Different type of outOfMemoryErrors in java, stackoverflow error(infinitely calling - recursive method)
OutOfMemoryError
	heap space
	GC Overhead limit exceeded
	permgen space(prior java 8)
	Metaspace(Java 8 onwards)
	etc
String:
=======
String Vs StringBuffer VS StringBuilder
Why String is immutable?
String constant pool?
Can we write our own immutable class?How?

Collection F/W:
=================
Difference b/w ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList Vs Vector?
Internal flow of Hashmap(Table, Bucket, Entry, Hashing, Loadfactor)
When do you need to override equals, hashcode methods? what is the contract between them?
What happens if you don't override equals, hashcode when using user defined object as key?
what happens becoz of poor hashcode implementation?
What happens if we use HashMap in multithreading environment?(infinite loop)
Sort HashMap by values
ConcurrentModification exception

Comparable VS Comparator
Difference between HashTable, Hashmap, SynchronizedHashMap, ConcurrentHashMap
Collections frequency(), min(), max()

weakHashMap, IdentityHashMap

Stream API:
===========
https://javaconceptoftheday.com/solving-real-time-queries-using-java-8-features-employee-management-system/
sort HashMap by value
Sort array or list of objects
flatmap
groupingby 
distinct

Multithreading:
=================
The default priority of a thread is its parent thread's priority. main() thread's priority is 5.
What is Synchronization? drawbacks?
Daemon thread
Runnable Vs Callable
Executor's submit vs execute
Completable Future

Spring:
==============
Advantage of Spring boot over traditional Spring
Spring MVC flow
Circular Dependency? Solution?
Scopes? usage?
Exceptional Handling
Injecting a prototype-scoped bean into a singleton bean (Expects @Lookup)

Http status code:
			Success			Failure	
GET			200/204/206		404					
PUT			200				404
POST		201				400
DELETE		200				404
PATCH		200				400
OPTIONS		NA				NA

204	No Content			The request has fulfilled the request but does not need to return an entity body
206	Partial Content		The server has fulfilled the partial GET request for the resource
400	Bad request			The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax
404	Not Found			The server has not found anything matching the request URI
405	Method Not allowed	The method specified in the request is not allowed for the resource identified by the request URI
409	Conflict			The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of resource
